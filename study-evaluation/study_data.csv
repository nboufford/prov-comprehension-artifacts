UBC CS - Research Proposal for Ethics ID#H23-00382



Principal Investigator: Thomas Pasquier, PhD Associate Professor UBC Computer Science tjfmp@cs.ubc.ca 

Co-Investigator: Nichole Boufford MSc Student UBC Computer Science ncbouf@cs.ubc.ca 



Invitation

You are being invited to take part in this research study because you have indicated that you are interested in participating in our research study. Purpose This study uses different provenance representations to guide the user in answering questions about a not seen before workflow. We are interested in understanding the benefits and drawbacks of using a graph-based representation and a report-based representation to present an experimental workflow.



Study Procedures

Pre-Activity Questionnaire (5 minutes) You will be given a questionnaire to fill out before the study activity.

Introduction and Overview (10 minutes) You will be given an introduction to the study and you will watch a video demonstration of the user tool.

Activity (30 minutes) You will be shown an interface representing an experimental workflow and you will use the interface to answer questions about the workflow while thinking out loud. This part of the session will be screen and audio recorded. You will repeat this task with one more workflow and a different experimental workflow representation.

Post-Activity Questionnaire (10 minutes) After the activity, you will complete a brief questionnaire, and answer any follow-up questions from the investigator.



Potential Risks

There is minimal risk to participating in this study. If you disclose any information you later wish to remove from the study, you can let us know at any time.



Potential Benefit

You learn about workflow analysis and will help to design a tool that might help data scientists to track experiments.



Confidentiality 

Your confidentiality will be respected. Any information that could identify you as a participant in this study will be kept confidential. Any personal data and recorded data that may reveal your identity will be removed. Personal data will not be released without your consent unless required by law. Any identifying information will be changed; for example, each subject will be assigned a study number, such as Participant #1 or Participant #2 or a pseudonym. Information that directly discloses your identity will remain only with the Principal Investigator and/or designate. Computer files will be password-protected and encrypted on a password-protected computer and all digital audio and computer interaction files will be deleted after 5 years.



Screen-recording and audio recording

The activity portion of the study will be screen and audio recording. The investigator will start and stop the recording for the participant.



Remuneration/Compensation

Participants will be compensated one $15 Amazon Gift Card for completing the session.



Use of Study Information

This study is part of a graduate research project and will be used in a dissertation. Data may be analyzed for academic publication and published in an anonymized and/or aggregated form. Anonymized data may be used for academic presentations on the publication.



Open Access 

Some of the journals or conferences that we may publish our results with may require open access to data. Open access means that the publication and data may be made available to the public. If it is required for us to publish our data, it will be in summary form with identifying information removed. No recordings will be published. However, any open access publication may still increase the risk that some of the published data is associated with you. Once the data is made available, you will not be able to withdraw your data.



Contact for information about the study:

If you have any questions, concerns, or desire for further information about this part of the study before or during participation, you may contact Dr. Thomas Pasquier at tjfmp@cs.ubc.ca.

 

Contact for concerns about the rights of research subjects: If you have any concerns or complaints about your rights as a research participant and/or your experiences while participating in this study, contact the Research Participant Complaint Line in the UBC Office of Research Ethics at 604-822-8598 or if long distance e-mail RSIL@ors.ubc.ca or call toll free 1-877-822-8598.



Consent 

Your participation in this study is entirely voluntary and you may refuse to participate or withdraw from the study at any time without jeopardy to your employment. If you choose to withdraw from the study, your data will be deleted.
